            You can upload your data to Galaxy using the Upload tool from anywhere in Galaxy.
            Just look for the "Upload data" button at the top of the tool panel.

          <p>
            We recommend subsampling large data sets to test tools and workflows.
            A useful tool is
            <code>seqtk_seq</code>,
            setting the parameter at "Sample fraction of sequences"
          </p>
