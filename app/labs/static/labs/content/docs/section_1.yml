          <p class="lead text-bf">A note on caching</p>
          <p>
            When making changes to your Lab content, you may notice that updates are not immediate. This is because of caching, which is used to speed up page loading time. There are two levels of caching to keep in mind:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Labs Engine caches Lab content forever, unless a request is made with the <code>cache=false</code> parameter. When you are developing your Lab page, use this parameter to see your changes immediately, for example:
              <a href="">http://{{ HOSTNAME }}/?content_root=https://github.com/myusername/myrepo/blob/branch/content/base.yml&cache=false</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              Using the <code>cache=false</code> parameter will refresh the cache.
              <!--
              This happens automatically on every pull request to the
              <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy_codex">
                Galaxy Codex
              </a>
              repository, where global Labs content is stored.
                -->
            </li>
            <li>
              When making changes to your Lab content, you may notice that updates are not immediate, because GitHub raw content is cached for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Caching is automatically disabled if you choose to
              <a
                href="#"
                data-bs-toggle="collapse"
                data-bs-target="#section_1-faq-2-collapse"
                aria-expanded="true"
                aria-controls="section_1-faq-2-collapse"
                onclick="document.getElementById('section_1-faq-2-collapse').scrollIntoView();"
              >render locally</a>!
            </li>
          </ul>

      - title_md: Can I render my page locally?
        description_md: |
          Yes, rendering your lab page locally makes for much faster debugging
          and polishing! To render your page locally, you will need to install
          the Galaxy Labs Engine CLI (requires `python>=3.10`):

          <div class="tab-content">
            <ul class="nav nav-tabs" id="installLabsEngine" role="tablist">
              <li class="nav-item" role="presentation">
                <button class="nav-link active" id="windows-tab" data-bs-toggle="tab" data-bs-target="#windows" type="button" role="tab" aria-controls="windows" aria-selected="true">Windows</button>
              </li>
              <li class="nav-item" role="presentation">
                <button class="nav-link" id="mac-linux-tab" data-bs-toggle="tab" data-bs-target="#mac-linux" type="button" role="tab" aria-controls="mac-linux" aria-selected="false">Mac/Linux</button>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="tab-content" id="installLabsEngineContent">
              <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="windows" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="windows-tab">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                  # create a virtual environment
                  # (alternatively, you may also wish to use conda for a global environment)
                  py -m venv venv
                  venv\Scripts\activate

                  # install the Labs Engine
                  pip install git+https://github.com/usegalaxy-au/galaxy-labs-engine.git

                  # Navigate to your content directory
                  cd %MY_CONTENT_DIR%

                  # serve base.yml in the current directory
                  labs-engine serve

                  # serve a specific page from the current directory
                  labs-engine serve usegalaxy.org.yml

                  # upgrade to the latest version (in future)
                  pip install --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/usegalaxy-au/galaxy-labs-engine.git
                </pre>
              </div>
              <div class="tab-pane fade" id="mac-linux" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="mac-linux-tab">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                  # create a virtual environment
                  python -m venv venv
                  source venv/bin/activate

                  # install the Labs Engine
                  pip install git+https://github.com/usegalaxy-au/galaxy-labs-engine.git

                  # Navigate to your content directory
                  cd $MY_CONTENT_DIR

                  # serve base.yml in the current directory
                  labs-engine serve

                  # serve a specific page from the current directory
                  labs-engine serve usegalaxy.org.yml

                  # upgrade to the latest version (in future)
                  pip install --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/usegalaxy-au/galaxy-labs-engine.git
                </pre>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          This should start a local development server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
          Click the link that appears and your lab page should open in the browser.

      - title_md: Can I write content in HTML?
        description_md: |
          Yes - any file/field that accepts markdown can also accept HTML,
          for example:

          - `intro.md`
          - `heading_md` (in section.yml)

          However, be careful about nesting HTML within markdown. Anything inside
          an HTML element must also be HTML. The following would be invalid:

          <pre class="prettyprint">
          &lt;p&gt;
            This is a paragraph with a
            [broken link](https://example.com).
          &lt;/p&gt;
          </pre>

      - title_md: Can I use variables in my content?
        description_md: |
          Yes! Using variables is a great way to make a Lab page reuable across
          Galaxy servers.
          Variables defined in the `base.yml`/<code>&lt;server&gt;.yml</code> file can be used anywhere
          that markdown or HTML content is provided. This includes templates like
          `intro.md` and also `section.yml` & `*_md` values. Any arbitrary variable
          that you set in the `base.yml`/<code>&lt;server&gt;.yml</code> file can be used in the content:

          1. `base.yml` or <code>&lt;server&gt;.yml</code>:
            <pre class="prettyprint lang-yaml">
            myvar: foo
            </pre>

          2. `intro.md`:
            <pre class="code">
            &#35; Analysis methods
            This is a great place for doing analysis such as &lbrace;&lbrace; myvar &rbrace;&rbrace;.
            </pre>

          3. `section_1.yml`:
            <pre class="prettyprint lang-yaml">
            ...
            &ndash; title_md: Can I use variables in my YAML and Markdown/HTML content?
              description_md: |
                Yes, you can use variables like &lbrace;&lbrace; myvar &rbrace;&rbrace;.
            </pre>

      - title_md: How to add links to tools/workflows?
        description_md: |
          To add Galaxy server links (e.g. any link to a usegalaxy.* site), you can use the <code>&lt;server&gt;.yml</code> variable `galaxy_base_url` to build a URL that always points to the Galaxy server that the Lab is being viewed on.

          ##### Linking to tools

          For creating tool URLs in either markdown, HTML or YAML, just copy the URL while you have the tool open in Galaxy, and replace the base URL with `galaxy_base_url` like so:

          <pre class="prettyprint">
          # Either of these work fine:
          &lbrace;&lbrace; galaxy_base_url }}/?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/fastqc/fastqc
          &lbrace;&lbrace; galaxy_base_url }}/?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu%2Frepos%2Fdevteam%2Ffastqc%2Ffastqc
          </pre>

          <p class="alert alert-warning">
            Make sure you remove the version from the end of the URL! This ensures that the user is always directed to the latest version of the tool.
          </p>

          ##### Linking to workflows

          For linking to a workflow, it's best to link to a TRS import from either WorkflowHub.eu or DockStore.org to ensure availability between Galaxy instances. You should be able to obtain the TRS ID from the workflow page on either of these sites:

          <pre class="prettyprint">
          &lbrace;&lbrace; galaxy_base_url }}/workflows/trs_import?trs_server=workflowhub.eu&run_form=true&trs_id=220
          </pre>

      - title_md: How to add buttons to my content?
        description_md: |

          You may have seen Labs with button links:

          <img alt="screenshot of content item with buttons" src="https://github.com/usegalaxy-au/galaxy-labs-engine/blob/dev/app/labs/static/labs/content/docs/static/tab-item-buttons.png?raw=true" class="shadow img-fluid" />

          We can create the above by providing a list of buttons in the content item YAML:

          <pre class="prettyprint lang-yaml">
          content:
            - title_md: Import data to Galaxy
              description_md: >
                Standard upload of data to Galaxy, from your computer or from the web.
              buttons:
                - icon: run
                  tip: Upload data to Galaxy
                  link: "&lbrace;&lbrace; galaxy_base_url }}/tool_runner?tool_id=upload1"
                - label_md: About
                  link: "https://galaxyproject.org/"
          </pre>

          See the full definition of `buttons` [here](/schema#tabitembutton). Try not to go overboard - one or two buttons is usually enough!

      - title_md: Can I exclude an item from specific hosts?
        description_md: |
          Yes, you can exclude any component in the section schema from specific
          hosts by listing server names under the
          [exclude_from directive](/schema#tabitem). The server name is just the
          base name of the <code>&lt;server&gt;.yml</code> file.
          This can be used to exclude items describing server-specific features,
          such as:

          <pre class="prettyprint lang-yaml">
          - title_md: How can I increase my storage quota?
            description_md: >
              Please submit a quota request if your Galaxy  account reaches its
              data storage limit. Requests are usually provisioned quickly if you
              provide a reasonable use case for your request.
            exclude_from:
              - usegalaxy.org  # matches the usegalaxy.org.yml content root
          </pre>

      - title_md: Can I add images into Markdown/HTML?
        description_md: |
          Yes, you can use standard Markdown or HTML syntax to include images.
          When adding the `src` atrribute to an image tag, you can use relative
          URLs to specify an image located in your content directory, or an
          absolute URL to an image hosted elsewhere on the web:

          Using Markdown:
          <pre class="code">
          ![My image description](./static/images/myimage.png)
          </pre>

          Using HTML (allows custom styling):
          <pre class="code">
          &#60;img src="&period;/static/images/myimage.png" alt="My image description" width="200" height="200"&#62;
          </pre>

          Or with a full URL (any image available online):
          <pre class="code">
          ![My image description](https://example.com/myimage.png)
          </pre>

      - title_md: How do I list contributors to my Galaxy Lab?
        description_md: |
          You can list contributors to your Galaxy Lab by adding a `CONTRIBUTORS`
          file to your content directory. This file should be a plain-text
          list of GitHub usernames - one per line. The Labs engine will fetch
          the user's profile information and display it at the bottom of your
          Lab Page. If a contributor does not have a GitHub account, you can
          just add their name.

      - title_md: Is there a way to check that all Galaxy tool links are working?
        description_md: |
          Yes - please use the built-in **audit feature** to automatically check
          whether all Galaxy tool links in your Lab page are accessible on the
          target Galaxy server. This helps ensure your Lab content stays
          up-to-date and functional.

          ##### Using the audit feature

          Add the `audit` parameter to any Lab page URL to audit that page. The URL must point to a <code>&lt;server&gt;.yml</code> file (not `base.yml`) so that it knows which server to check against. For example:

          <pre class="prettyprint">
          https://{{ HOSTNAME }}/?content_root=https://github.com/myuser/myrepo/blob/main/content/usegalaxy.org.yml&cache=false&audit
          </pre>

          ##### What to expect

          - A popup will list linked tools that are not installed on the target server
          - Tabs and accordion sections containing broken tool links will be highlighted in red
          - The page title will include "- AUDIT" to indicate **audit mode** is active

          ##### What gets checked

          The audit feature automatically:

          - Extracts all Galaxy tool links from your Lab page content
          - Uses the Galaxy API to verify each tool exists on the target server
          - Caches Galaxy API results for 30 minutes to avoid repeated checks
          - Shows detailed error messages for unavailable tools

          ##### Interpreting audit results

          - **Green "Audit success" button**: All linked tools are available
          - **Red "Audit issues" button**: Some tools are unavailable
          - **Highlighted sections/tabs**: Contain links to unavailable tools

          <p class="alert alert-info">
            A broken tool link doesn't always indicate that a tool is missing from the server - sometimes it's just a typo!
          </p>

      Some more content to demonstrate multiple tabs in a section.
      If you want to have a tab with just Markdown/HTML content and no
      expandable items, you can just use the `heading_md` field and set
      `content: []` like we have done here.
