    title: FAQs
    heading_md: |
      This is a section. A section is composed of a title (*"Creating sections"*)
      and one or more tabs. Each tab is composed of a title (*"FAQs"*), heading
      text (*this*) and a collection of collapsable items.
      Sections are rendered from data specified in a YAML file.
      The structure of the YAML file is important, and must follow the
      [defined schema](/schema). The two sections below give examples of how
      content can be nested in sections.
    content:
      - title_md: Can I write content in HTML?
        description_md: |
          Yes - any file/field that accepts markdown can also accept HTML,
          for example:

          - `intro.md`
          - `heading_md` (in section.yml)

          However, be careful about nesting HTML within markdown. Anything inside
          an HTML element must also be HTML. The following would be invalid:

          <pre class="prettyprint">
          &lt;p&gt;
            This is a paragraph with a
            [broken link](https://example.com).
          &lt;/p&gt;
          </pre>

      - title_md: Can I use variables in my content?
        description_md: |
          Yes! Using variables is a great way to make a Lab page reuable across
          Galaxy servers.
          Variables defined in the base.yml/server.yml file can be used anywhere
          that markdown or HTML content is provided. This includes templates like
          `intro.md` and also section.yml `*_md` values. Any arbitrary variable
          that you set in the base.yml/server.yml file can be used in the content:

          1. `base.yml` or `[server].yml`:
            <pre class="prettyprint lang-yaml">
            myvar: foo
            </pre>

          2. `intro.md`:
            <pre class="code">
            &#35; Analysis methods
            This is a great place for doing analysis such as &lbrace;&lbrace; myvar &rbrace;&rbrace;.
            </pre>

          3. `section_1.yml`:
            <pre class="prettyprint lang-yaml">
            ...
            &ndash; title_md: Can I use variables in my YAML and Markdown/HTML content?
              description_md: |
                Yes, you can use variables like &lbrace;&lbrace; myvar &rbrace;&rbrace;.
            </pre>

      - title_md: Can I exclude an item from specific hosts?
        description_md: |
          Yes, you can exclude any component in the section schema from specific
          hosts by listing hostnames under the
          [exclude_from directive](/schema#tabitem).
          This can be used to exclude items describing server-specific features,
          such as:

          <pre class="prettyprint lang-yaml">
          - title_md: How can I increase my storage quota?
            description_md: >
              Please submit a quota request if your Galaxy  account reaches its
              data storage limit. Requests are usually provisioned quickly if you
              provide a reasonable use case for your request.
            exclude_from:
              - usegalaxy.org
          </pre>

      - title_md: Can I add images into Markdown/HTML?
        description_md: |
          Yes, you can use standard Markdown or HTML syntax to include images.
          When adding the `src` atrribute to an image tag, you can use relative
          URLs to specify an image located in your content directory, or an
          absolute URL to an image hosted elsewhere on the web:

          Using Markdown:
          <pre class="code">
          ![My Image](./static/images/myimage.png)
          </pre>

          Using HTML (allows custom styling):
          <pre class="code">
          &#60;img src="./static/images/myimage.png" alt="My Image" width="200" height="200"&#62;
          </pre>

          With a full URL:
          <pre class="code">
          [![My Image](https://example.com/myimage.png)](https://example.com/myimage.png)
          </pre>
