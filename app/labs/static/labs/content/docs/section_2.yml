    title: Tools
    heading_md: |
      This is a section. A section is composed of a title (*"Example section"*)
      and one or more tabs. Each tab is composed of a title (*"Tools"*), heading
      text (*this*) and a collection of collapsable items.
      Sections are rendered from data specified in a YAML file.
      The structure of the YAML file is important, and must follow the
      [defined schema](/schema). The two sections below give examples of how
      content can be nested in sections.

        title_md: FastQC - sequence quality reports
        description_md: >
          Before using your sequencing data, it's important to ensure that
          the data quality is sufficient for your analysis.
        inputs:
          - label: Sequencing data for analysis

    title: Workflows
    heading_md: >
      A workflow is a series of Galaxy tools that have been linked together
      to perform a specific analysis. You can use and customize the example workflows
      below.

          You can upload your data to Galaxy using the Upload tool from anywhere in Galaxy.
          Just look for the "Upload data" button at the top of the tool panel.

          We recommend subsampling large data sets to test tools and workflows.
          A useful tool is `seqtk_seq`, setting the parameter at "Sample fraction of sequences".
