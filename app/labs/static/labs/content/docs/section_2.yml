    title: Tools
    heading_md: |
      This is a section. A section is composed of a title (*"Example section"*)
      and one or more tabs. Each tab is composed of a title (*"Tools"*), heading
      text (*this*) and a collection of collapsable items.
      Sections are rendered from data specified in a YAML file.
      The structure of the YAML file is important, and must follow the
      [defined schema](/schema). The two sections below give examples of how
      content can be nested in sections.

      A workflow is a series of Galaxy tools that have been linked together
      to perform a specific analysis. You can use and customize the example workflows
      below.

      - title_md: How can I import my genomics data?
        description_md: |
          You can upload your data to Galaxy using the Upload tool from anywhere in Galaxy.
          Just look for the "Upload data" button at the top of the tool panel.

      - title_md: How can I subsample my data?
        description_md: |
          We recommend subsampling large data sets to test tools and workflows.
          A useful tool is `seqtk_seq`, setting the parameter at "Sample fraction of sequences".
