          Before using your sequencing data, it's important to ensure that
          the data quality is sufficient for your analysis.

      A workflow is a series of Galaxy tools that have been linked together
      to perform a specific analysis. You can use and customize the example workflows

            You can upload your data to Galaxy using the Upload tool from anywhere in Galaxy.
            Just look for the "Upload data" button at the top of the tool panel.

          <p>
            We recommend subsampling large data sets to test tools and workflows.
            A useful tool is
            <code>seqtk_seq</code>,
            setting the parameter at "Sample fraction of sequences"
