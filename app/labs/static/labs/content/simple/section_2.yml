      The tools in this section have been divided into subsections to make it
      easier for users to find the tools they need. This must replace the
      entire value of the `content` key i.e. you can't mix
      subsections with standalone items.

      - title_md: Can I use Galaxy Australia to assemble a large genome?
        description_md: >
          Yes. Galaxy Australia has assembly tools for small prokaryote genomes as well as larger eukaryote genomes.
          We are continually adding new tools and optimising them for large genome assemblies - this means adding enough computer processing power to run data-intensive tools, as well as configuring
          aspects such as parallelisation.

          - you need to increase your data storage limit
          - there is a tool you wish to request
          - a tool appears to be broken or running slowly

          - See the tutorials in this Help section. They cover different approaches to genome assembly
          - Read the methods in scientific papers about genome assembly, particularly those about genomes with similar characteristics to those in your project
          - See the Workflows section for examples of different approaches to genome assembly - these cover different sequencing data types, and a variety of tools.
